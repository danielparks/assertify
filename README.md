# Assertify

Convenience macros to make Rust code tests from simple expressions.

```rust
testify!(concat_literals, concat("a", "b") == "ab");

#[test]
fn my_test() {
  assertify!(concat("a", "b") == "ab");
}
```

## To do

  * Improve compilation errors when `assertify!` is given something other than
    a comparison.
  * Document macros
